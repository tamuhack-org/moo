            <p>Devpost is the platform that pretty much all hackathons use for project submission. This is where you can
              tell us all about your project and be eligible to have your project judged and potentially win prizes.
              Teams will submit to Devpost AND present their project to judges in-person. Click the “Go to Devpost”
              button at the top of the page to visit our Devpost page and start your project submission! <strong>
                You can edit
                your submission even after your press submit.
              </strong></p>

          <section id="team" class="stack">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Team</h2>
            <p>Add all the people who worked with you on the project. You can invite them by email or give them an
              invite link.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Project Info</h2>
            <p>Add the name of your project and a short description of it. Remember the name you chose because this is
              the name we will use for your table assignment.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Project Story and Image Gallery</h2>
            <p>This is the best part! Go into as much detail as you would like and tell us all about your project. Talk
              about all the features your project has and how it was made. Tell us what motivated you to make it, the
              things you learned while making it, and any obstacles you encountered. Your Devpost plays a big role in
              how your project is judged so we recommend putting lots of thought and effort into it! And don’t forget to
              add lots of images and videos of your project in action!</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Github Repo and Links</h2>
            <p>You are REQUIRED to submit a GitHub repository containing your code. We want to see your development
              process and what’s behind all the amazing things in your project! Any of our organizers can help you with
              uploading your code to GitHub if you need help. Furthermore, if you deployed your project publicly on the
              web or have any useful links for your project, we’d love to see them in this section.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Video Demo</h2>
            <p>A brief video demo showing your project in action is REQUIRED for all submissions. Upload your video to
              YouTube and add a link to it here. Make sure your video is publicly accessible (public or unlisted) and is
              <strong>no more than 3 minutes long.</strong>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Tracks **Important</h2>
            <p>This is the <strong>most important part of the entire submission</strong>. Select the tracks that you
              want to be judged
              for. If you do not select your desired tracks, you will likely NOT be judged for those tracks and or be
              eligible for a prize in that category. You may submit to multiple tracks. All projects are automatically
              entered into Best Overall.</p>
