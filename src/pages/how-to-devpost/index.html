                                Devpost is the platform that pretty much all
                                hackathons use for project submission. This is
                                where you can tell us all about your project and
                                be eligible to have your project judged and
                                potentially win prizes. Teams will submit to
                                Devpost AND present their project to judges
                                in-person. Click the “Go to Devpost” button at
                                the top of the page to visit our Devpost page
                                and start your project submission!

                                project. Talk about all the features your
                                project has and how it was made. Tell us what
                                motivated you to make it, the things you learned
                                while making it, and any obstacles you
                                encountered. Your Devpost plays a big role in
                                how your project is judged so we recommend
                                putting lots of thought and effort into it! And
